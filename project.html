    <p id="text">Motivation of a climbing robot with the ability to maneuver on vertical surfaces is to increase the operation efficiency in dangerous environments or places which are dangerous for human beings where safety measurements are too important. wall climbing robots are used in applications such as inspection ,welding , etc. All these robots are developed by using different types of techniques like: vacuum suction, magnetic or electromagnetic force, or gripping with claws. Every technique has some positive points and restrictions. For instance, magnetic adhesion can be used for a strong base for a high safety purpose, but is used only for ferromagnetic surfaces and for iron surface. Second technique, suction adhesion is based upon a complete vacuum with the surface, walking on porous & non- porous surfaces. The proposed system is to make a robot which can climb easily on wall and preferably on any type of wall.

        <p id="text1">In the current scenario most of the countries do not have sufficient skilled man power than specifically affects the agricultural sector and the growth of developing countries. So it’s a time to automate the sector to overcome this problem. An innovative idea of our project “An Autonomous Agricultural Seed Sowing Robot” is to automate the process of sowing crops such as sunflower, baby corn, groundnut and vegetables like beans, lady’s finger, pumpkin and pulses like black gram, green gram etc., to reduce the human effort and increase the yield. The plantations of seeds are automatically done by using DC motor. The distance between the two seeds are controlled and varied by using Microcontroller. It is also possible to cultivate different kinds of seeds with different distance. When the Robot reaches the end of the field we can change the direction with the help of remote switches. The whole process is controlled by Microcontroller.

        <p id="text2">We have come across a canvas roll slitting and packing industry which had an issue in manual roll slitter machine. They couldn’t able to adopt to fully automatic roll slitter in the market because of very high cost. So, buying a fully automatic machine is of no use. That’s why we thought of automating only the part they require. Retrofitting is technology measures taken in the manufacturing industry to allow new or updated parts to be fitted to old or outdated assemblies. Semi-automating this could possibly solve most of the issues with the current machine. Motorizing the movement of the cutting bed is most effective solution for it. Stepper motor will the best choice to make precise moves. A controller will be installed to control each stepping of the cutting bed. Thus, more precise dimensioned product will be achieved. This will also reduce the material loss per roll, which thereby increases the production rate.
